# About
In this repo I'm building an operational database for an ecommerce platform, using popular tech-shop "Komplett.no" as a reference. 
The database contains real product data, scraped from komplett, as well as other dummy data for table population.
I'm also building a data warehouse using a dimensional model, where the aim is to do analysis on sales data in Power Bi.

## Ideas
- Build operational database
- Build dimensional data warehouse
- Scrape product data
- Generate dummy data
- Write ETL processes
- Do analysis with Power Bi

## Tools
- Python
- Dbeaver (postgreSQL)
- Power Bi
- Draw.io (ERD design)

## Future work
- Scrape all product data
- Generate more sales data for deeper analysis
- Implement big data tools (Kafka, Spark)
- Automate with Airflow
- Migrate to Snowflake
- Build a GUI or web solution to interact with DBs
