# About
In this repo I've built an operational database for an ecommerce platform, using popular tech-shop "Komplett.no" as a reference. 
The database contains real product data scraped from komplett, as well as other generated data for table population.
Finally I've built a data warehouse using a star schema approach, used for doing BI analysis.

The project will be updated continously. This is not it's final form.
