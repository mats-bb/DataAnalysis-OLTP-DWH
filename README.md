# About
Using komplett.no as a reference to build an operational database as well as a data warehouse, to get a deeper understanding of datamodeling concepts. See raw .svg file for current ERD progress.

## Ideas
- Build OLTP system
- Build OLAP system
- Connect Power Bi to OLAP for analysis
- Scrape actual product data from Komplett to populate DB
- Populate other tables with dummy-data
- Build GUI to emulate placing orders etc
- Run queries
