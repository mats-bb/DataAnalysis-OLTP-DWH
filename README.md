# About
Using komplett.no as a reference to build an operational database as well as a data warehouse to run analysis on, to get a deeper understanding of datamodeling concepts. See raw .svg file for current ERD progress.

! This project will be updated constantly. What you see now is not necessarily indicative of the end result. !

## Ideas
- Build OLTP system
- Build dimensional dwh
- Connect Power Bi to dwh for analysis
- Scrape actual product data from Komplett to populate DB
- Populate other tables with dummy-data
- Build GUI to emulate placing orders etc
- Run queries
